# About Me
I am an undergraduate B-Tech student pursuing a degree in computer science, with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am always eager to learn and expand my skill set, particularly in emerging technologies.

I am particularly interested in applications of AI and ML in fields such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity, and I am always seeking new opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge.

As I continue to develop my skills and expertise, I am excited to explore opportunities to work with others who share my passion for technology and innovation.
